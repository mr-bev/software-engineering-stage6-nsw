# Number Systems

## Binary

The Binary Number System is a cornerstone of digital technology. It is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit (which represents (2^0)).


### Converting Decimal to Binary

Convert the decimal number 5 to its binary representation.

Divide the number by 2 and note the remainder.

```
5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1
```

Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient is zero.

```
2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
```
Read the remainders from bottom to top:

Binary representation of 5 is 101.

### Converting Decimal to Binary

Convert the binary number 101 back to its decimal representation.

Write down the binary number and assign each digit a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit (which represents (2^0)).

`101₂ = 1 * (2^2) + 0 * (2^1) + 1 * (2^0)`

Calculate each term and sum them up.

```
1 * (2^2) = 4
0 * (2^1) = 0
1 * (2^0) = 1

4 + 0 + 1 = 5
```
So, the binary number 101 represents the decimal number 5.
