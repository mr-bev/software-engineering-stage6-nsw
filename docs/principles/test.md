# Testing

Testing is the process of verifying that software meets its requirements. It involves identifying and evaluating defects or errors in the software to ensure it functions as intended. Testing can be performed at various levels, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

## Functional Testing

Functional testing focuses on verifying that each function or feature within the application behaves as expected. The primary goal of functional testing is to ensure that all parts of an application work together correctly and produce the desired output when given specific inputs. Functional testing is a mix of automated and manual testing techniques. Typically the smaller the test the more automated and frequent you want it to be run.


!!! note
    Functional testing will test both functional and non-functional requirements. It is also important to have positive and negative testing scenarios to ensure that all possible outcomes are covered.

### Key Aspects of Functional Testing:

1. **Requirements Validation**: Ensuring that the actual implementation meets the requirements specified during the design phase.
2. **Feature Verification**: Checking individual features or modules for correctness.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: Testing scenarios at the extremes (e.g., maximum and minimum values, extreme conditions).
4. **User Interface Testing**: Verifying that the application's user interface behaves correctly and is intuitive to use.
5. **Usability Testing**: Evaluating how easy it is for users to interact with the application.

### Types of Functional Tests:

#### Unit Testing
   - **Definition**: The smallest testable part of an application is tested, often performed by developers.
   - **Frequency**: These will be run daily by developers and the CI/CD processes. There can be 100s to 10,000s of tests in a large system.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure that individual units (methods or functions) work as intended.
   - **Example Tools**: JUnit, NUnit, unittest, pytest


#### Integration Testing
   - **Definition**: Testing the interfaces between software modules to ensure they communicate correctly.
   - **Frequency**: Are typically automated but might be less frequent as they test the interaction between different components. These are run infrequently by a developer, typically only when changing the part of the system that the tests verify. They will be run in the CI/CD pipeline on every commit or maybe nightly depending on the complexity of the system.
   - **Purpose**: To verify that different components of the application work together seamlessly.
   - **Example Tools**: Selenium WebDriver, Postman. Tools in unit testing can also be used for integration testing.


#### System Testing
   - **Definition**: A comprehensive test conducted on a complete and fully integrated system to verify that it meets its specified requirements.
   - **Frequency**: More likely to be manual tests and run less frequently. Typically before each release or before merging changes into a production branch.
   - **Purpose**: To validate the entire system as a whole against the requirements.
   - **Example Tools**: LoadRunner, JMeter, Behave, Lettuce

#### Acceptance Testing
   - **Definition**: Testing performed to determine whether a software product meets the end-user requirements and is fit for deployment.
   - **Purpose**: To ensure that the application satisfies user needs before it is released to production.
   - **Example Tools**: Selenium WebDriver, Postman, Robot Framework

#### Regression Testing
   - **Definition**: Testing conducted after changes (such as new features or bug fixes) are made to ensure that existing functionality continues to work correctly.
   - **Purpose**: To prevent the introduction of new bugs during code modifications.
   - **Example Tools**: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD

### Test Design Techniques:

1. **Equivalence Partitioning**:
    - Dividing input values into partitions based on whether they produce equivalent results and testing representative elements from each partition.

2. **Boundary Value Analysis**:
    - Testing at the boundaries between valid and invalid inputs to ensure that error conditions are handled correctly.

3. **State Transition Diagrams**:
    - Using diagrams to model how the application transitions between states, often used in testing finite state machines (FSMs).

4. **Decision Table Testing**:
    - Creating tables that list all combinations of input values and expected outcomes to test all possible scenarios.

### Benefits of Functional Testing

1. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that software meets the specified requirements.
2. **User Confidence**: Provides users with confidence in the applicationâ€™s reliability.
3. **Cost Reduction**: Identifies defects early, reducing the cost of fixing them later.
4. **Compliance**: Ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations.

### Challenges of Functional Testing

1. **Complexity**: Applications often have many features, making it challenging to test every combination.
2. **Resource Intensive**: Large-scale testing can be resource-intensive in terms of time, cost, and human resources.
3. **Dynamic Nature**: Software requirements can change frequently, requiring continuous adaptation of tests.

Functional testing ensures that applications are built to meet user needs and perform as expected. By using various techniques and tools, developers can effectively conduct functional testing and deliver high-quality software products.
