# Software Development Life Cycle

The Software Development Life Cycle *SDLC* is the core of software engineering. It aims to produce software products that meet or exceed customer expectations, even for the most basic needs. This structured process integrates critical stages to deliver high-quality results through every stage of product development, from conception to operation. The primary goal is to manage each phase efficiently while supporting customers with maximum effectiveness and timeliness. By doing so, SDLC ensures a well-designed, functional, and user-friendly product that meets customer requirements. There are many different models that can be followed but they all have similar components.

## Planning

Planning is critical to the success of most software development projects. Plans along with estimates of effort guide investment decisions. A company may be willing to invest in a 6 month project that may require 4 *FTEs* but they may resist or refuse to invest in a project that will take many years of investment or even more than 1 year. Planning is difficult and can also be wrong. This can result in some teams avoiding to plan at all, and not able to answer simple question like "when can this be ready?". They can also spend too much time in planning trying to account for everything but their plans are not gaaranteed to be right or stay accurate after the first day of design or code. Barry Boehm described the range of uncertainty with planning and estimates when describing the waterfall model.

This shows that at the planning phase the schedule can be out by a factor of +160% or -60% and as progress is made and more is understood about the system under development those plans and estimates become more certain. 

Planning is done to:

- Identify and reduce risk
- Reduce the uncertainty of delivering a solution
- Support better decision making around doing a project and where best to invests time, money and resources.
- Establish trust with the customer through planning frequent and reliable delivery of features and trust between management and developers that timelines can be acheived and not at the cost of bugs and poor code due to poor planning.
- It also allows a customer to pick and choose features. Maybe a low priority feature can be dropped if it would take too long to develop.
- Conveys expectations and sets a baseline of what can be delivered. It does not gaurantee all features can be delivered on time and on budget.

A common idiom in the software development life cycle is that you can have a project delivered on time, on budget or all features, pick two. The meaning behind this is that software development is complex and typically by the end of the project one of these 3 requirements is sacrificed to deliver a product.

### Why Plans Fail
<div class="annotate" markdown>
- Nearly 2 out of 3 projects significanly overrun their cost estimates (1)
- 64% of of features included in products are not used (2)
- The average project exceeds its schedule by 100% (3)
