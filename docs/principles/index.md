# Principals of Software Engineering

Software engineer, software developer, computer scientist or maybe just tech support, a career in software can be very rewarding, challenging, confronting and boring. Hopefully more of the prior, and the later is up to you to make a change and not accept the status quo. 

## What is a Project?
A project is a temporary endeavor with defined goals, scope, and deliverables, undertaken by a specific team or individual to achieve a specific objective or set of objectives. It typically involves a range of tasks, activities, and resources, managed within a planned timeframe, budget, and constraints. Projects differ from routine tasks or business-as-usual activities like maintaining software as they have a defined duration and scope of work.

Key characteristics of a project include:

- Specific goals and objectives
- Defined scope and boundaries
- Temporary in nature (starts and ends with a defined timeline)
- Managed by a specific team or individual (project manager)
- Requires planning, resources allocation, and monitoring
- Has a clear set of deliverables and outcomes

## Project Management
Many different project methodologies exist to provide a structure approach to managing projects. These methodologies are typically what a project or product manager follows when working with a team of software engineers to communicate what the business or client is expecting and what the engineerigg team will deliver.

    - **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
    - **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
    - **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
    - **Responding to change** over following a plan
