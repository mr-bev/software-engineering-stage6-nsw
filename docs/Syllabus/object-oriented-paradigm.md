## Understanding OOP

| Key | Description | Reference | Comment |

| [](){#OO-UO-01} OO-UO-01 | Apply the key features of an object-oriented programming (OOP) language | | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-01.01} OO-UO-01.01 | :material-circle-medium: objects | | |

| [](){#OO-UO-01.03} OO-UO-01.03 | :material-circle-medium: encapsulation | [Encapsulation](../object_oriented_software/key_concepts.md#encapsulation-material-school) | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-01.04} OO-UO-01.04 | :material-circle-medium: abstraction | | |

| [](){#OO-UO-01} OO-UO-02 | Compare procedural programming with OOP | Programming Paradigms | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-01} OO-UO-03 | Use data flow diagrams, structure charts and class diagrams to represent a system | Design | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-04} OO-UO-04 | Describe the process of design used to develop code in an OOP language | |  | 
| [](){#OO-UO-04.01} OO-UO-04.01 | :material-circle-medium: task definition | | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-04.02} OO-UO-04.02 | :material-circle-medium: top-down and bottom-up | | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-04.03} OO-UO-04.03 | :material-circle-medium: facade pattern | Software Design Patterns | Another odd decision to only focus on the facade pattern when there are many more and more commonly used ones | 
| [](){#OO-UO-04.04} OO-UO-04.04 | :material-circle-medium: agility | | Not sure what this means. You don't normally talk about code from an agility pov, I can only think they mean the -ilitiies of software engineering | 
| [](){#OO-UO-05} OO-UO-05 | Assess the effectiveness of programming code developed to implement an algorithm | Big-O | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-06} OO-UO-06 | Investigate how OOP languages handle message-passing between objects | | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-07} OO-UO-07 | Explain code optimisation in software engineering | Big-O | | 
| [](){#OO-UO-08} OO-UO-08 | Outline the features of OOP that support collaborative code development | | I would expect things like clean code and SOLID to discussed. These and below are just good software practices and not specific to OO | 
| OO-UO-08.01 | :material-circle-medium: consistency | Clean Code | | 
| OO-UO-08.02 | :material-circle-medium: code commenting | Clean Code | | 
| OO-UO-08.03 | :material-circle-medium: version control | RCS | I am assuming this means revision control systems and not *SemVer* or similar | 
| OO-UO-08.04 | :material-circle-medium: feedback | Code Reviews | Feedback is great but not specific to coding | 

## Programming in OOP

| Key | Description | Reference | Comment |
| :----: | ---- | :----: | ---- |
| OO-PO-01 | Design and implement computer programs involving branching, iteration and functions in an OOP language for an identified need or opportunity | | | 
| OO-PO-02 | Implement and modify OOP programming code | | | 
| OO-PO-02.01 | :material-circle-medium: clear and uncluttered mainline | SOLID | Seems to be a relic of the old syllabus. OO is far more dynamic and this should really be about *SOLID* principles | 
| OO-PO-02.01 | :material-circle-medium: one logical task per subroutine | SOLID | Another relic. I guess they mean single responsibility principle. | 
| OO-PO-02.02 | :material-circle-medium: use of stubs | | Not an OO principle, just general development and more likely used when testing | 
| OO-PO-02.03 | :material-circle-medium: use of control structures and data structures | | | 
| OO-PO-02.04 | :material-circle-medium: ease of maintenance | -ilities and Clean Code | | 
| OO-PO-02.05 | :material-circle-medium: version control | | Deja-vu | 
| OO-PO-02.06 | :material-circle-medium: regular backup | | I guess this would be your git workflow using github or similar | 
| OO-PO-03 | Apply methodologies to test and evaluate code | | | 
| OO-PO-03.01 | :material-circle-medium: unit, subsystem and system testing | Testing | | 
| OO-PO-03.02 | :material-circle-medium: black, white and grey box testing | Testing | | 
| OO-PO-03.03 | :material-circle-medium: quality assurance | | Cyclo-metrics, linters, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ |
