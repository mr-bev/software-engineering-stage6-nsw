# Machine Learning

!!! Note
    This has been called **Software Automation** in the syllabus but is not accurate. The syllabus is heavily focused on Machine Learning (ML) and to be called Software automation should focus on other automation activities. This would include DevOps and DevSecOps being the practice of creating software applications to reduce human intervention in time consuming IT tasks like cloud operations, deployments, and software and system orchestration.
