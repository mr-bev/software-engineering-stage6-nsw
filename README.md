Reference material for the stage 6 software engineering subject in NSW education

This material has been created as an alternative to providing a textbook to stage 6 (year 11 and 12) students. If you find this material useful please feel free to use and or contribute additional resources, corrections and omissions. 

Note: My opinions may differ from that of the syllabus material and I will try to clearly indicate when that is the case and why.

The documentation is created using mkdocs-material for no other reason than it works for me.
