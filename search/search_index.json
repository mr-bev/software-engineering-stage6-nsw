Over the past 20+ years I have gather some knowledge, managed some great people and made mistakes. I am at a cross road and have decided to head in a different direction and apply my knowledge to teaching Software subjects in NSW Secondary Schools.

The term \"shift left\" means to move concerns and consideration in the SDLC closer to the beginning rather than the end of the life-cycle to ensure software meets design. Examples of this are:</p> <ul> <li>consider security issues up front and develop code that builds in security from the get go rather than an add-on</li> <li>focus on testing, code quality and performance earlier in the development cycle</li> <li>create the build, test process before building the software</li> </ul> <p>The other side of DevOps is shift right where testing, quality and performance is done under real-world conditions. This means software running in production can handle real user load while maintaining quality. </p>"},{"location":"Syllabus/object-oriented-paradigm/","title":"The Object Oriented Paradigm","text":"<p>NESA</p>"},{"location":"Syllabus/object-oriented-paradigm/#understanding-oop","title":"Understanding OOP","text":"Key Description Reference Comment  OO-UO-01 Apply the key features of an object-oriented programming (OOP) language  OO-UO-01.01  objects  OO-UO-01.02  classes  OO-UO-01.03  encapsulation Encapsulation  OO-UO-01.04  abstraction  OO-UO-01.05  inheritance  OO-UO-01.06  generalisation  OO-UO-01.07  polymorphism  OO-UO-02 Compare procedural programming with OOP Programming Paradigms  OO-UO-03 Use data flow diagrams, structure charts and class diagrams to represent a system Design  OO-UO-04 Describe the process of design used to develop code in an OOP language  OO-UO-04.01  task definition  OO-UO-04.02  top-down and bottom-up  OO-UO-04.03  facade pattern Software Design Patterns Another odd decision to only focus on the facade pattern when there are many more and more commonly used ones  OO-UO-04.04  agility Not sure what this means.

A company may be willing to invest in a 6 month project that may require 4 FTEs<sup>6</sup> but they may resist or refuse to invest in a project that will take many years of investment or even more than 1 year. Planning is difficult and can also be wrong. This can result in some teams avoiding to plan at all, and not able to answer simple question like \"when can this be ready?\". They can also spend too much time in planning trying to account for everything but their plans are not guaranteed to be right or stay accurate after the first day of design or code.

One of the main issues is that it assumes that all requirements are known at the beginning of the project and that they will not change throughout the development process.

Review","text":"# <p>Question 1: What is the primary purpose of using <code>type=\"email\"</code> instead of <code>type=\"text\"</code> for an email input field?</p> It makes the input field look differentIt stores the email in localStorage automaticallyIt provides built-in browser validation and shows appropriate mobile keyboardsIt encrypts the email address for security <p>Explanation</p> <p>The <code>type=\"email\"</code> attribute provides built-in HTML5 validation to check for basic email format (e.g., <code>user@domain.com</code>) and triggers mobile devices to display email-optimized keyboards with @ and .com keys, improving user experience.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - the visual appearance is controlled by CSS, not the input type</li> <li>Option B is incorrect - storage must be explicitly handled with JavaScript</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - input types don't provide encryption; that happens server-side with HTTPS</li> </ul> # <p>Question 2: When styling form inputs, which CSS property controls the visibility of error messages that appear below invalid fields?</p> <code>visibility: hidden</code> and <code>visibility: visible</code><code>display: none</code> and <code>display: block</code><code>opacity: 0</code> and <code>opacity: 1</code><code>position: absolute</code> and <code>position: relative</code> <p>Explanation</p> <p>The <code>display</code> property is used to completely hide elements (<code>display: none</code>) and make them visible (<code>display: block</code>). When hidden with <code>display: none</code>, the element takes up no space in the layout. A class like <code>.error-message.show { display: block; }</code> is toggled via JavaScript to show/hide error messages.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - <code>visibility: hidden</code> hides the element but it still takes up space in the layout</li> <li>Option C is incorrect - <code>opacity</code> makes elements transparent but they still occupy space and can be interacted with</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - <code>position</code> properties control element placement, not visibility</li> </ul> # <p>Question 3: A user logs in WITHOUT checking the \"Remember me\" checkbox. They close their browser tab and open a new tab to the same website. What happens to their session?</p> The session persists because it was saved in localStorageThe session is lost because it was stored in sessionStorage, which is tab-scopedThe session persists because cookies are always permanentThe session is lost because the browser always clears all data when tabs close <p>Explanation</p> <p>When \"Remember me\" is NOT checked, the session data is stored in <code>sessionStorage</code>, which is cleared when the browser tab is closed. Each tab has its own separate sessionStorage, and the data does not persist across tabs or after closing.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - localStorage is only used when \"Remember me\" IS checked</li> <li>Option C is incorrect - cookies can be session-based (cleared on browser close) or persistent; not all are permanent</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - the browser doesn't clear all data; localStorage persists, only sessionStorage is tab-scoped</li> </ul> # <p>Question 4: Examine this JavaScript code from the login form:</p> <pre><code>if (password.length &lt; 8) {\n    document.getElementById('password').classList.add('error');\n    document.getElementById('passwordError').textContent = 'Password must be at least 8 characters';\n    document.getElementById('passwordError').classList.add('show');\n    hasErrors = true;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>What is the purpose of adding the 'error' class to the password input element?</p> To validate the password on the serverTo store the error in localStorageTo apply CSS styling that changes the input's border to red, providing visual feedbackTo prevent the user from typing more characters <p>Explanation</p> <p>Adding the 'error' class applies CSS rules like <code>input.error { border-color: #f44336; }</code>, which changes the visual appearance of the input to indicate validation failure. This provides immediate visual feedback to the user.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - server validation happens separately; this is client-side only</li> <li>Option B is incorrect - classes don't interact with localStorage; they only affect styling</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - the class doesn't prevent input; it only changes appearance</li> </ul> # <p>Question 5: Why should authentication error messages be generic (e.g., \"Invalid email or password\") rather than specific (e.g., \"Email not found\" or \"Incorrect password\")?</p> Generic messages are easier to translate into other languagesSpecific messages require more database queriesGeneric messages prevent attackers from discovering which email addresses have accounts, improving securityGeneric messages take up less space on the screen <p>Explanation</p> <p>Generic error messages are a security best practice because they prevent user enumeration attacks. If the system says \"Email not found,\" an attacker can systematically test email addresses to discover which ones have accounts. Generic messages like \"Invalid email or password\" don't reveal whether the email exists, making it harder for attackers to gather information.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - while true, this is not the primary security reason</li> <li>Option B is incorrect - database queries happen regardless of the message shown</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - screen space is not a security consideration</li> </ul> # <p>Question 6: Analyze this code that stores session data:</p> <pre><code>const sessionData = {\n    userId: 'user_12345',\n    email: 'student@example.com',\n    loginTime: new Date().toISOString(),\n    rememberMe: true\n};\n\nlocalStorage.setItem('userSession', JSON.stringify(sessionData));\n</code></pre> <p>What security vulnerability exists in storing authentication data this way in a production application?</p> The userId is too short and easy to guessUsing JSON.stringify makes the data visible in DevToolslocalStorage is accessible to JavaScript, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks that could steal the session tokenThe email address should be encrypted before storage <p>Explanation</p> <p>Storing authentication tokens or session data in <code>localStorage</code> creates a significant XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability. If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, they can read <code>localStorage</code> and steal session data. Production applications should use httpOnly cookies (set by the server), which JavaScript cannot access, preventing XSS attacks from stealing tokens.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - userId length isn't the primary security concern here</li> <li>Option B is partially true but not the main vulnerability; DevTools access requires physical access to the device</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - the email isn't the sensitive data; the session token is, and client-side encryption doesn't solve the XSS problem</li> </ul> # <p>Question 7: A developer wants to show a session timeout warning 1 minute before the session expires (5-minute timeout). They need to track when the user last performed an action. Which approach correctly implements this?</p> Use <code>setInterval()</code> to check <code>Date.now()</code> every second and compare to <code>loginTime</code>Store the expiry time in a cookie and check it on every page loadTrack <code>lastActivityTime</code>, update it on user events (click, scroll, keypress), and use <code>setInterval()</code> to check if <code>Date.now() - lastActivityTime &gt; 4 minutes</code>Use <code>setTimeout()</code> with a fixed 4-minute delay that triggers on page load <p>Explanation</p> <p>Session timeouts are based on inactivity, not total session time. The correct approach tracks the last user activity by listening to events like clicks, scrolls, or keypresses, updating <code>lastActivityTime</code>. A periodic check (using <code>setInterval()</code>) compares the current time to <code>lastActivityTime</code>. If the idle time exceeds 4 minutes (in a 5-minute timeout), show the warning.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - comparing to <code>loginTime</code> measures total session duration, not inactivity</li> <li>Option B is incorrect - cookies don't help track client-side activity timing without JavaScript</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - a fixed 4-minute delay from page load doesn't account for user activity extending the session</li> </ul> # <p>Question 8: Evaluate this password strength validation logic:</p> <pre><code>function calculatePasswordStrength(password) {\n    let score = 0;\n    if (password.length &gt;= 8) score += 2;\n    if (password.length &gt;= 12) score += 1;\n    if (/[A-Z]/.test(password)) score += 1;\n    if (/[a-z]/.test(password)) score += 1;\n    if (/[0-9]/.test(password)) score += 1;\n    if (/[!@#$%^&amp;*]/.test(password)) score += 2;\n\n    if (score &lt;= 3) return 'weak';\n    else if (score &lt;= 6) return 'medium';\n    else return 'strong';\n}\n</code></pre> <p>A user enters the password <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> (16 'a' characters). What strength rating will it receive, and why is this problematic?</p> 'weak' - the function correctly identifies it as weak because it has no variety'medium' - the function incorrectly rates it as medium because it only checks for character types present, not password complexity or common patterns'strong' - the function incorrectly rates it as strong because of the lengthThe function will throw an error because the password is too simple <p>Explanation</p> <p>The password <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> scores: - +2 for length \u2265 8 - +1 for length \u2265 12 - +1 for lowercase letters</p> <p>Total: 4 points = 'medium' rating</p> <p>This reveals a critical flaw in the validation: it doesn't check for: - Repeated characters - Common patterns (e.g., <code>12345678</code>, <code>qwerty</code>) - Dictionary words - Lack of entropy/randomness</p> <p>A strong password validator should check against common password lists and patterns, not just character variety. The password <code>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> is extremely weak despite meeting length requirements.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - the function gives 4 points (medium), not weak</li> <li>Option C is incorrect - it doesn't reach 7+ points for strong</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - JavaScript regex tests don't throw errors for simple strings; they just return false</li> </ul> # <p>Question 9: A developer is implementing the \"Remember me\" feature. Which approach best demonstrates the 'privacy by design' principle?</p> Automatically check the \"Remember me\" box by default to improve user convenienceStore all user data permanently in localStorage for faster page loadsLeave \"Remember me\" unchecked by default and clearly explain that checking it stores session data persistently on the deviceUse localStorage for all users regardless of their choice to simplify code <p>Explanation <code>Privacy by design</code> requires that privacy-protective settings are the default and users must explicitly opt-in to less private options. Leaving \"Remember me\" unchecked by default (using sessionStorage) is more privacy-protective, and providing clear information allows informed consent.</p> <p>Option A violates privacy by design - users should opt-in, not opt-out Option B violates user privacy and data minimization principles Option D removes user choice entirely, violating privacy principles</p>"},{"location":"web_development/client_side_security_user_experience/#understanding-check","title":"Understanding Check","text":"<p>Self-Assessment Checklist</p> <p>Before moving on, make sure you can confidently answer \"yes\" to these questions:</p> <p>1: Client-Side Storage</p> <ul> <li> Can you explain the differences between cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage?</li> <li> Do you understand why passwords should never be stored client-side?</li> <li> Can you identify what types of data are safe to store in localStorage?</li> <li> Do you know how to inspect storage in browser DevTools?</li> </ul> <p>2: Session Concepts</p> <ul> <li> Can you describe the session lifecycle (login \u2192 activity \u2192 logout/timeout)?</li> <li> Do you understand the difference between session IDs and session tokens?</li> <li> Can you explain what happens when a session expires?</li> </ul> <p>3: Authentication UI</p> <ul> <li> Can you build a login form with proper UX (password toggle, loading states)?</li> <li> Do you understand why error messages should be generic?</li> <li> Can you implement \"remember me\" functionality with different storage strategies?</li> <li> Can you create a registration form with real-time validation?</li> </ul> <p>4: Password Validation</p> <ul> <li> Can you implement a password strength meter with visual feedback?</li> <li> Do you understand what makes a password strong?</li> <li> Can you validate passwords against common password lists?</li> <li> Can you provide helpful feedback to users about password requirements?</li> </ul> <p>5: Dashboard &amp; Session Management</p> <ul> <li> Can you create a dashboard that checks for active sessions?</li> <li> Can you implement session timeout warnings?</li> <li> Do you understand how to track session duration and idle time?</li> <li> Can you handle logout properly (clearing all session data)?</li> </ul> <p>Overall Understanding</p> <ul> <li> Do you understand the limitations of client-only security?</li> <li> Can you explain why server-side validation is essential?</li> <li> Do you know which storage mechanism to use in different scenarios?</li> <li> Can you articulate the difference between UX and security in authentication?</li> </ul> <p>Critical Limitation Reminder</p> <p>Everything built in this lesson is client-side only and therefore:</p> <ul> <li>NOT secure for production use</li> <li>Easily bypassed by users</li> <li>Vulnerable to XSS attacks</li> <li>Missing server-side validation</li> <li>Educational demonstration only</li> </ul> <p>Real authentication requires: - Server-side credential validation - Secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2) - httpOnly, secure cookies - HTTPS/TLS encryption - CSRF protection - Rate limiting - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</p>"},{"location":"web_development/client_side_security_user_experience/#6-teacher-notes","title":"6.

Caching Benefits</p> <p>If a user visited any other website that uses the same CDN link, they already have Bootstrap cached in their browser!</p> <pre><code>graph TD\n    A[User visits Website A] --&gt;|Downloads Bootstrap from CDN| B[Browser Cache]\n    B --&gt;|Stores Bootstrap| C[Cached File]\n    D[User visits YOUR Website] --&gt;|Needs Bootstrap| E{Already in cache?}\n    E --&gt;|Yes!| F[Use cached version&lt;br/&gt;No download needed!]\n    E --&gt;|No| G[Download from CDN]\n\n    style F fill:#e1ffe1\n    style G fill:#fff4e1</code></pre> <p>4. Reliability &amp; Redundancy</p> <p>CDNs have multiple backup servers. If one fails, another takes over automatically.</p> <p>5. DDoS Protection</p> <p>CDNs can absorb malicious traffic before it reaches your server.</p> <p>Who Needs a CDN?</p> User Type Need for CDN? Why? Student learning web dev Nice to have Fast setup, free to use Personal blog Optional Probably low traffic Small business website Recommended Improves user experience E-commerce site Essential Speed = sales; global customers News website Essential Traffic spikes, global audience Streaming service Critical Massive files, many users Enterprise application Critical Performance, reliability, security <p>General rule: The more traffic or the more global your audience, the more you need a CDN.</p> <p>When to Use a CDN</p> <p>Use a CDN when:</p> <ul> <li>\u2705 You're using popular libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery, React)</li> <li>\u2705 Your users are spread across different countries</li> <li>\u2705 You want to improve page load speed</li> <li>\u2705 You're learning/prototyping (easiest setup)</li> <li>\u2705 You want to reduce your hosting costs</li> <li>\u2705 Your site experiences traffic spikes</li> </ul> <p>Consider NOT using a CDN when:</p> <ul> <li>\u274c You need guaranteed offline functionality</li> <li>\u274c You have strict privacy/compliance requirements (some CDNs track requests)</li> <li>\u274c You're in a restricted network environment (some firewalls block CDNs)</li> <li>\u274c You need 100% control over file availability</li> <li>\u274c You're developing on a plane/remote location without internet</li> </ul> <p>Understanding CDN Links</p> <p>Let's break down a CDN URL:</p> <pre><code>https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\n</code></pre> Part Meaning <code>https://</code> Secure protocol (always use HTTPS!) <code>cdn.jsdelivr.net</code> The CDN domain <code>/npm/</code> Source (npm package registry) <code>bootstrap</code> Package name <code>@5.3.0</code> Specific version (important!) <code>/dist/css/</code> Path within the package <code>bootstrap.min.css</code> The actual file (<code>.min</code> = minified) <p>Always Specify Versions</p> <p>Notice the <code>@5.3.0</code> in the URL? This locks to a specific version.</p> <ul> <li>\u2705 Good: <code>bootstrap@5.3.0</code> (specific version)</li> <li>\u274c Risky: <code>bootstrap@latest</code> (could break your site when updated)</li> </ul> <p>Security Considerations with CDNs</p> <p>Subresource Integrity (SRI)</p> <p>When using a CDN, there's a small risk the file could be tampered with.

This creates a snapshot of your current work that you can return to later.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - <code>git save</code> is not a valid Git command</li> <li>Option C pushes to remote repository but doesn't save locally first</li> <li>Option D pulls changes from remote, it doesn't save your work</li> </ul> # <p>Question 2: A student complains they can't navigate the file upload form using only their keyboard. This violates which principle?</p> Privacy by DesignSDLC best practicesAccessibility (WCAG)Responsive design <p>Explanation</p> <p>Keyboard navigation is a core accessibility requirement under WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). All interactive elements must be operable via keyboard for users who cannot use a mouse.</p> <ul> <li>Option A (Privacy by Design) focuses on data protection, not navigation</li> <li>Option B (SDLC) is a general development process, not specific to keyboard access</li> <li>Option D (Responsive design) addresses different screen sizes, not input methods</li> </ul> # <p>Question 3: In which SDLC phase should you implement password hashing?</p> Requirements (define that passwords must be hashed)Design (plan the hashing algorithm)Development (write the hashing code)All of the above <p>Explanation</p> <p>Security considerations, including password hashing, must be integrated throughout the entire SDLC:</p> <ul> <li>Requirements phase: Specify that passwords must be hashed (security requirement)</li> <li>Design phase: Choose the hashing algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2) and plan implementation</li> <li>Development phase: Write the actual code that performs the hashing</li> </ul> <p>This demonstrates \"Security by Design\" - security isn't added at the end, it's built in from the start.</p> # <p>Question 4: The upload form uses a CDN for Bootstrap. The CDN goes down. What happens?</p> The form still works but looks unstyledThe form completely breaksUsers see an error messageThe browser uses a cached version <p>Explanation</p> <p>If a CDN is unavailable, the Bootstrap CSS simply won't load, but the HTML still functions. The page will display with browser default styling (unstyled but functional).</p> <ul> <li>Option B is incorrect - HTML functionality isn't dependent on CSS</li> <li>Option C is incorrect - browsers don't show errors for missing CSS files</li> <li>Option D is possible if the file was previously cached, but the question implies the CDN is currently down, so we can't assume a cache hit</li> </ul> <p>This illustrates a key disadvantage of CDN hosting - external dependency.</p> # <p>Question 5: Which Bootstrap class makes a layout stack vertically on mobile but display in 3 columns on desktop?</p> <code>col-12 col-lg-4</code><code>col-mobile-1 col-desktop-3</code><code>responsive-3-col</code><code>col-sm-12 col-md-4</code> <p>Explanation</p> <p><code>col-12 col-lg-4</code> means: - <code>col-12</code>: Take all 12 columns (full width) on extra small and small screens (mobile) - <code>col-lg-4</code>: Take 4 out of 12 columns (one-third width) on large screens (desktop)</p> <p>This creates the stacking behavior on mobile and 3-column layout on desktop.</p> <ul> <li>Option B uses non-existent Bootstrap classes</li> <li>Option C is not a valid Bootstrap class</li> <li>Option D would create 3 columns starting at medium (tablet) size, not large (desktop)</li> </ul> # <p>Question 6: A commit message reads: \"fix stuff\". What's wrong with this?</p> It's not descriptive enough to understand what changedIt should use past tense (\"Fixed stuff\")It should reference a ticket numberNothing - it's fine <p>Explanation</p> <p>Good commit messages clearly describe what changed and why. \"fixed stuff\" provides no useful information for:</p> <ul> <li>Other team members reviewing the history</li> <li>Future you trying to understand what was fixed</li> <li>Security audits tracking changes</li> </ul> <p>Better examples:</p> <ul> <li>\u2705 \"Fix XSS vulnerability in comment input field\"</li> <li>\u2705 \"Add input validation to prevent SQL injection\"</li> <li>\u274c \"fixed stuff\"</li> </ul> <p>Others:</p> <ul> <li>Option B: While past tense is preferred by some teams, the real problem is lack of detail</li> <li>Option C: Ticket numbers are helpful but not always required</li> <li>Option D: This is definitely not fine!</li> </ul> # <p>Question 7: Which is an example of \"Privacy as Default\"?</p> Requiring users to opt-in to data collectionMaking profiles private unless user chooses publicAsking for minimal data during registrationProviding a privacy policy link <p>Explanation</p> <p>\"Privacy as Default\" means the system provides maximum privacy without any user configuration. Making profiles private by default ensures privacy protection immediately, and users must actively choose to make their profile public.</p> <ul> <li>Option A describes opt-in consent, which is good practice but not \"privacy as default\"</li> <li>Option C describes data minimisation, a different privacy principle</li> <li>Option D is about transparency, not default privacy settings</li> </ul> <p>Example: A messaging app with end-to-end encryption turned ON by default (users don't have to find and enable it).</p> # <p>Question 8: Why might you choose local hosting over CDN for Bootstrap in a school project?</p> It's always fasterThe school network blocks external CDNsIt has better securityBootstrap isn't available on CDNs <p>Explanation</p> <p>Many schools, corporate networks, and restricted environments block external CDN domains for security or policy reasons. In these cases, local hosting is the only option.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect - CDNs are typically faster due to geographic distribution</li> <li>Option C is debatable - both can be secure when properly configured</li> <li>Option D is incorrect - Bootstrap is widely available on multiple CDNs (jsDelivr, cdnjs, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Other valid reasons for local hosting:</p> <ul> <li>Need for offline functionality</li> <li>Privacy/compliance requirements</li> <li>Complete control over file availability</li> </ul>"},{"location":"web_development/css_frameworks_version_control_secure_dev/#4-syllabus-alignment","title":"4.

These questions increase in difficulty from basic recall to advanced application.</p> # <p>Question 1: What is the primary purpose of using <code>textContent</code> instead of <code>innerHTML</code> when displaying user input?</p> It improves page load performanceIt prevents XSS attacks by treating content as plain textIt allows for better styling with CSSIt is required by modern web standards <p>Explanation</p> <p><code>textContent</code> treats all content as plain text and will not execute any HTML or JavaScript, preventing XSS attacks. This is the key security benefit when handling user-generated content.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect\u2014while there may be minor performance differences, this is not the primary reason</li> <li>Option C is incorrect\u2014both methods have the same CSS styling capabilities</li> <li>Option D is incorrect\u2014both methods are valid in web standards; <code>textContent</code> is simply safer for user content</li> </ul> # <p>Question 2: How does the following <code>escapeHTML()</code> function sanitise user input?</p> <pre><code>function escapeHTML(str) {\n    const div = document.createElement('div');\n    div.textContent = str;\n    return div.innerHTML;\n}\n</code></pre> It removes all HTML tags from the stringIt uses textContent to force the browser to encode special HTML characters, then reads the encoded version using innerHTMLIt validates the string against a regular expression patternIt encrypts the string using a cryptographic algorithm <p>Explanation</p> <p>When you set <code>textContent</code>, the browser automatically encodes special characters like <code>&lt;</code> to <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> to <code>&amp;gt;</code>. Reading <code>innerHTML</code> returns this encoded version, which is safe to display.</p> <p>For example: - Input: <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</code> - After <code>textContent</code>: Browser internally stores it as <code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('XSS')&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;</code> - <code>innerHTML</code> returns: <code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('XSS')&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;</code> - When displayed, user sees the text, script doesn't execute</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect\u2014tags are encoded (converted to entities), not removed</li> <li>Option C is incorrect\u2014no regex is used; it relies on browser's built-in encoding</li> <li>Option D is incorrect\u2014this is encoding, not encryption</li> </ul> # <p>Question 3: You need to display a user's comment that may contain special characters. Which implementation is the MOST secure?</p> <code>element.innerHTML = userInput;</code><code>element.innerHTML = userInput.replace('&lt;script&gt;', '');</code><code>element.textContent = userInput;</code><code>element.innerHTML = userInput.toLowerCase();</code> <p>Explanation</p> <p>Using <code>textContent</code> ensures all content is treated as plain text, preventing any code execution regardless of input content. This is the safest approach.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is vulnerable to XSS\u2014if <code>userInput</code> contains <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</code>, it will execute</li> <li>Option B uses blacklist filtering which is insufficient\u2014attackers can bypass with <code>&lt;img onerror='alert(1)'&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Script&gt;</code> (uppercase), or dozens of other variations</li> <li>Option D is still vulnerable\u2014converting to lowercase doesn't prevent XSS; <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('xss')&lt;/script&gt;</code> will still execute</li> </ul> <p>Best Practice: Always use <code>textContent</code> for user-generated content unless you have a specific, well-justified reason to use <code>innerHTML</code> with properly sanitized content.</p> # <p>Question 4: Validation Process </p> <p>A web application validates usernames client-side (3-20 characters, alphanumeric only) using JavaScript, then sends them to a Python backend. An attacker submits <code>&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</code> directly to the API endpoint using curl, bypassing the web form. What happens and why?</p> <pre><code>curl -X POST https://example.com/api/register \\\n  -d \"username=&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;\"\n</code></pre> The attack fails because the client-side JavaScript validation prevents the submissionThe attack fails because the browser's built-in XSS protection blocks itThe attack succeeds if the server doesn't validate the input, because client-side validation was bypassedThe attack fails because HTML cannot be transmitted through API requests <p>Explanation</p> <p>Direct API requests completely bypass all JavaScript validation. The server receives the malicious payload as a string and will process it if server-side validation is missing. Client-side validation is only for user experience, not security.</p> <p>This demonstrates the critical principle: Never trust the client. The Python backend MUST validate independently:</p> <pre><code># Server must validate!\ndef validate_username(username):\n    if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,20}$', username):\n        abort(400, \"Invalid username format\")\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect\u2014curl requests never touch the client-side JavaScript</li> <li>Option B is incorrect\u2014browser protections don't apply to direct API requests, and they're not a substitute for proper validation</li> <li>Option D is incorrect\u2014any text (including HTML/JavaScript) can be sent as data in API requests</li> </ul> <p>Key Takeaway: Always implement server-side validation. Client-side validation improves UX but provides zero security.</p> # <p>Question 5: Review this comment system implementation. What is the PRIMARY security vulnerability?</p> <pre><code>// User posts a comment\nlet comment = document.getElementById('commentInput').value;\n\n// Validation\nif (comment.length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; comment.length &lt;= 500) {\n    // Create display\n    let commentHTML = `\n        &lt;div class=\"comment\"&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;${escapeHTML(comment)}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    `;\n\n    // Add to page\n    document.getElementById('comments').innerHTML += commentHTML;\n}\n</code></pre> The validation only checks length, not content patternUsing template literals can allow XSS because they create HTML contextUsing <code>innerHTML +=</code> re-parses all existing comments, which could cause issues if previous comments weren't properly escapedThe escapeHTML function doesn't work with template literals <p>Explanation</p> <p>The <code>innerHTML +=</code> operation is the primary vulnerability. Here's what happens:</p> <ol> <li>Read current <code>innerHTML</code> (all existing comments)</li> <li>Parse it back into a string</li> <li>Concatenate new content</li> <li>Parse and render everything again</li> </ol> <p>If ANY existing comment somehow contains unescaped content (perhaps from a previous bug, database compromise, or different code path), it gets re-evaluated and could execute.</p> <p>Better approach: <pre><code>// Option 1: Use appendChild\nlet commentDiv = document.createElement('div');\ncommentDiv.className = 'comment';\nlet p = document.createElement('p');\np.textContent = comment; // Safe!\ncommentDiv.appendChild(p);\ndocument.getElementById('comments').appendChild(commentDiv);\n\n// Option 2: Use insertAdjacentHTML (safer than innerHTML +=)\ndocument.getElementById('comments').insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', commentHTML);\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect\u2014while better validation is good practice, <code>escapeHTML()</code> handles dangerous content</li> <li>Option B is incorrect\u2014the escaped content is safe in template literals</li> <li>Option D is incorrect\u2014<code>escapeHTML()</code> is called first, returns an escaped string, which is then inserted into the template</li> </ul> # <p>Question 6: Security and Functionality</p> <p>You're designing a secure user profile system where users can set a display name and bio. The bio may contain line breaks and basic markdown formatting (bold, italic). Which architecture provides the BEST balance of security and functionality?</p> Allow full HTML in bio, use innerHTML to display it, rely on Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSSClient-side: validate format/length. Server-side: validate again, sanitise HTML, store sanitised HTML. Display: use innerHTMLClient-side: validate format/length, convert markdown to HTML. Server-side: validate, strip ALL HTML, store plain text. Display: render markdown using a trusted libraryStore bio as-is. When displaying, use escapeHTML() then use regex to replace \\n with <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags <p>Explanation</p> <p>This design follows security best practices:</p> <p>Architecture: <pre><code>// Client-side (UX layer)\nfunction validateBio(bio) {\n    if (bio.length &gt; 500) return false;\n    // Show preview with markdown rendered\n    return true;\n}\n\n// Server-side (Security layer - Python example)\ndef process_bio(bio):\n    # Validate\n    if len(bio) &gt; 500:\n        abort(400, \"Bio too long\")\n\n    # Strip ALL HTML (store plain text only)\n    bio_clean = strip_html(bio)\n\n    # Store plain text with markdown\n    save_to_database(bio_clean)\n\n// Display (Render time)\nfunction displayBio(bioText) {\n    // Use trusted markdown library\n    let safeHTML = markdownLibrary.render(bioText);\n    element.innerHTML = safeHTML; // Safe because library sanitises\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Why this is best: 1. Store plain text - Safest possible storage format 2. Render at display time - Easy to update sanitisation rules without touching stored data 3. Use trusted library - Don't write your own markdown parser 4. Validate both sides - UX on client, security on server 5. Defence in depth - Multiple layers of protection</p> <p>Why other options fail:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Option A: Allowing full HTML is dangerous even with CSP. CSP helps but isn't foolproof (can be bypassed, misconfigured, or not supported). Never store unsanitised HTML.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option B: Storing sanitised HTML creates problems:</p> </li> <li>If sanitisation library has bugs, all stored data is compromised</li> <li>Can't easily update sanitisation rules</li> <li> <p>Must trust past sanitisation forever</p> </li> <li> <p>Option D: Multiple issues:</p> </li> <li>No validation means unlimited length accepted</li> <li>Replacing <code>\\n</code> with <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> after escaping won't work (you'd see literal <code>&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;</code> text)</li> <li>Can't support any formatting like bold/italic</li> <li>Wrong order: need to parse BEFORE escaping, not after</li> </ul> <p>Real-world example: This is similar to how GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Reddit handle user content\u2014store markdown, render on display.</p> <p>```</p>"},{"location":"web_development/javascript_fun_client_security/#syllabus-alignment","title":"Syllabus Alignment","text":"<p>This lesson fully covers the following syllabus

scanners</li> <li>Address: Security is everyone's responsibility</li> </ul> <p>Misconception 6: \"JavaScript and Java are related\"</p> <ul> <li>Reality: Completely different languages</li> <li>Evidence: Compare syntax, use cases, history</li> <li>Address: Clarify early and consistently</li> </ul> <p>Misconception 7: \"innerHTML is fine if I sanitise first\"</p> <ul> <li>Reality: Better to use textContent - why take the risk?</li> <li>Evidence: Show edge cases where sanitisation fails</li> <li>Address: Emphasise textContent as best practice</li> </ul> <p>Misconception 8: \"Regex patterns are universal\"</p> <ul> <li>Reality: Validation requirements vary by context and region</li> <li>Evidence: International phone numbers, addresses, names</li> <li>Address: Discuss context-specific validation</li> </ul> <p>Misconception 9: \"Security makes sites unusable\"</p> <ul> <li>Reality: Good security enhances trust and can improve UX</li> <li>Evidence: Examples of secure AND usable forms</li> <li>Address: Part 4 focuses on balancing security and UX</li> </ul> <p>Misconception 10: \"I can learn regex completely in this lesson\"</p> <ul> <li>Reality: Regex is complex and takes practice</li> <li>Evidence: Show advanced regex examples</li> <li>Address: Provide resources, encourage ongoing learning</li> </ul> Assessment Evidence <p>Student work should

Unlike encryption (which is reversible), hashing cannot be reversed to obtain the original password. This protects user passwords even if the database is compromised. </p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect because hashing is one-way (not encryption)</li> <li>Option B is incorrect as compression is not the purpose</li> <li>Option D is incorrect as hashing doesn't change the user's password itself</li> </ul> # <p>Question 2: A student creates a Flask route - which statement best describes a security issue? <pre><code>    @app.route('/profile', methods=['GET'])\n    def profile():\n        username = request.args.get('username')\n        return f\"&lt;h1&gt;Welcome {username}&lt;/h1&gt;\"\n</code></pre></p> The route should use POST instead of GET for better securityThe username parameter is not validated or sanitised, allowing potential XSS attacksFlask automatically sanitises all input, so this code is secureThe route should check if the user is logged in before displaying the profile <p>Explanation The code directly inserts user input (<code>username</code>) into HTML without any validation or sanitisation. An attacker could pass <code>username=&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;</code> to execute malicious JavaScript.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect because GET is acceptable for retrieving data (though authentication should be checked)</li> <li>Option C is completely false\u2014Flask does not automatically sanitise input in f-strings</li> <li>Option D identifies another issue but is not the primary security vulnerability shown in this code pattern</li> </ul> # <p>Question 3: Which code snippet correctly verifies the password 'MyPassword123'?</p> <pre><code>The stored password hash in the database is:\n</code></pre> <p><code>$2b$12$KIXr7QFWGhEwqYLx8E5.3.zX8kP6vY9fJ2rN4sT1uV3wX5yZ7aB2C</code></p> <code>if hash_password(\"MyPassword123\") == stored_hash: login_success()</code><code>if \"MyPassword123\" == decrypt_password(stored_hash): login_success()</code><code>if bcrypt.checkpw(\"MyPassword123\".encode('utf-8'), stored_hash.encode('utf-8')): login_success()</code><code>if stored_hash.verify(\"MyPassword123\"): login_success()</code> <p>Explanation Option C correctly uses <code>bcrypt.checkpw()</code> to verify the password against the stored hash. It properly encodes the password to bytes and compares it with the hash. The bcrypt algorithm handles the salt extraction and comparison internally.</p> <ul> <li>Option A is incorrect because hashing the input password again will produce a different hash due to a new random salt\u2014you cannot compare hashes directly</li> <li>Option B is incorrect because hashing is one-way and cannot be decrypted</li> <li>Option D is incorrect because bcrypt hashes are byte strings, not objects with methods</li> </ul> # <p>Question 4: Compare these two session management approaches - which analysis is correct?</p> <p>Developer A's approach: <pre><code>    @app.route('/dashboard')\n    def dashboard():\n        user_id = request.cookies.get('user_id')\n        if user_id:\n            user = get_user(user_id)\n            return render_template('dashboard.html', user=user)\n        return redirect('/login')\n</code></pre></p> <p>Developer B's approach: <pre><code>    @app.route('/dashboard')\n    def dashboard():\n        if not session.get('logged_in'):\n            return redirect('/login')\n        user_id = session.get('user_id')\n        user = get_user(user_id)\n        return render_template('dashboard.html', user=user)\n</code></pre></p> Developer A's approach is more secure because cookies are encrypted by the browserDeveloper B's approach is more secure because server-side sessions are harder to manipulate than client-side cookiesBoth approaches are equally secure as long as HTTPS is usedDeveloper A's approach is better because it reduces server load by not storing session data <p>Explanation Developer B uses Flask's server-side session system (which stores session data on the server and only sends a session ID to the client). This is more secure because:</p> <ul> <li>Session data cannot be modified by the client</li> <li>The session is cryptographically signed</li> <li>Additional checks like <code>logged_in</code> status are stored server-side</li> </ul> <p>Developer A's approach is vulnerable because:</p> <ul> <li>Cookies can be easily modified by users using browser dev tools</li> <li>A user could change <code>user_id=123</code> to <code>user_id=456</code> to access another user's dashboard</li> <li>There's no verification that the user actually logged in</li> </ul> <p>Other options are incorrect:</p> <ul> <li>Option A: cookies are not encrypted by default</li> <li>Option C: HTTPS encrypts transmission but doesn't prevent client-side cookie manipulation</li> <li>Option D: identifies a performance consideration but ignores the critical security flaw</li> </ul> # <p>Question 5: Evaluate these security measures for a student portal - which evaluation is most accurate?</p> <p>Proposed security measures:</p> <ol> <li>Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, no complexity requirements</li> <li>Hashing Algorithm: SHA-256 without salting</li> <li>Session Timeout: 24 hours of inactivity</li> <li>Input Validation: Client-side JavaScript validation only</li> <li>HTTPS: Only on the login page, HTTP for other pages</li> </ol> The security measures are adequate for a school environment since students aren't high-value targetsMeasures 1 and 3 are acceptable, but measures 2, 4, and 5 have critical security flaws that must be addressedAll measures except 3 are secure; the session timeout should be reduced to 1 hourThe measures are acceptable if the school also implements two-factor authentication <p>Explanation Let's evaluate each measure:</p> <p>Measure 1 (Acceptable): 8 characters minimum is the bare minimum acceptable. While complexity requirements are debated, length is most important.</p> <p>Measure 2 (CRITICAL FLAW): SHA-256 without salting is vulnerable to rainbow table attacks. Even with salting, SHA-256 is too fast for password hashing. Should use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 with proper salting.</p> <p>Measure 3 (Acceptable): 24-hour timeout is reasonable for a student portal.</p> <p>Measure 4 (CRITICAL FLAW): Client-side validation can be completely bypassed using browser dev tools or direct HTTP requests. Server-side validation is mandatory for security.</p> <p>Measure 5 (CRITICAL FLAW): Using HTTP for authenticated sessions means session cookies and all data are sent in plain text. An attacker on school WiFi could steal session cookies. HTTPS must be used site-wide.</p> <p>Why other options are incorrect:</p> <ul> <li>Option A: security shouldn't be compromised based on perceived threat level; student data is protected by privacy laws</li> <li>Option C: incorrectly identifies only one issue</li> <li>Option D: 2FA doesn't fix the fundamental flaws in measures 2, 4, and 5</li> </ul> # <p>Question 6: Design a secure authentication system for a medical records application</p> <p>Scenario: You are building a web application for a medical clinic that stores patient records. The system needs:</p> <ul> <li>Different user types: patients can view their own records, doctors can view/edit patient records, admins can manage all users</li> <li>Protection against unauthorised access to sensitive medical data</li> <li>A record of who accessed which patient files and when (for legal compliance)</li> <li>Protection from common attacks (XSS, SQL injection, session hijacking, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Question: Which security implementation provides the MOST complete protection for this medical application?</p> Option A: bcrypt password hashing \u2022 Users' access levels checked using JavaScript in the browser\u2022 Sessions expire after 15 minutes\u2022 HTTPS on all pages\u2022 Form validationOption B: Argon2 password hashing \u2022 Access permissions checked on the server against a database of user roles\u2022 Sessions expire after 15 minutes AND session IDs change after login\u2022 HTTPS on all pages with forced HTTPS redirect\u2022 All inputs validated on server with SQL injection protection\u2022 Every file access is logged with username, timestamp, and which record was accessedOption C: Passwords stored without hashing (the database file itself is encrypted)\u2022 Access control on server\u2022 Sessions never expire for doctor convenience\u2022 HTTPS only on login page\u2022 Validation on both client and serverOption D: bcrypt password hashing\u2022 Access permissions managed by JavaScript code\u2022 Sessions last 24 hours\u2022 HTTPS on all pages\u2022 User inputs are cleaned before use <p>Explanation</p> <p>Correct Answer: Option B</p> <p>Medical applications require the highest security standards due to privacy laws (like HIPAA in the US or similar regulations). Option B is the only one that addresses ALL critical requirements:</p> <p>Why Option B is the BEST choice:</p> <p>\u2705 Argon2 password hashing</p> <ul> <li>Most secure modern algorithm, specifically designed to resist specialised hardware attacks</li> <li>Better than bcrypt for high-security applications</li> </ul> <p>\u2705 Server-side role checking against database</p> <ul> <li>Users cannot modify their own permissions</li> <li>Every page load verifies: \"Does this user REALLY have permission to see this data?\"</li> </ul> <p>\u2705 Session timeout + ID regeneration</p> <ul> <li>15-minute timeout prevents abandoned computers from being used</li> <li>Changing session ID after login prevents \"session fixation\" attacks</li> </ul> <p>\u2705 HTTPS everywhere with forced redirect</p> <ul> <li>All data encrypted in transit</li> <li>Automatic redirect prevents accidentally using HTTP</li> </ul> <p>\u2705 Server validation + SQL injection protection</p> <ul> <li>Using prepared statements makes SQL injection impossible</li> <li>Server validation cannot be bypassed by users</li> </ul> <p>\u2705 Audit logging</p> <ul> <li>CRITICAL for medical applications - required by law</li> <li>If there's a privacy breach, you can trace who accessed what and when</li> </ul> <p>Why the other options FAIL:</p> <p>\u274c Option A has a CRITICAL flaw:</p> <ul> <li>\"Access levels checked using JavaScript in the browser\" means any user can open browser dev tools (F12) and change their role from \"patient\" to \"doctor\" or \"admin\"</li> <li>They could then access ANY patient's records</li> <li>This is completely unacceptable for medical data</li> <li>Also missing: audit logging (legally required)</li> </ul> <p>\u274c Option C has MULTIPLE critical flaws:</p> <ul> <li>Plain text passwords: If someone steals the database file, they have everyone's passwords immediately (even if the file is encrypted, once they decrypt it, passwords are exposed)</li> <li>No session timeout: A doctor could log in, walk away from their computer, and anyone could access patient records</li> <li>HTTPS only on login: After login, all data (including patient records) is sent unencrypted over the network where it can be intercepted</li> <li>Missing: Audit logging</li> </ul> <p>\u274c Option D has critical flaws:</p> <ul> <li>JavaScript access control: Same problem as Option A - users can bypass it entirely</li> <li>24-hour sessions: Far too long for medical data - an unlocked computer could be used all day</li> <li>No SQL injection protection mentioned</li> <li>Missing: Audit logging</li> </ul> <p>Real-World Context:</p> <p>Medical applications face legal requirements like:</p> <ul> <li>HIPAA (USA): Requires audit trails, encryption, access controls</li> <li>GDPR (Europe): Requires data protection by design</li> <li>Australian Privacy Principles: Require reasonable security measures</li> </ul> <p>A security breach in medical software can result in:</p> <ul> <li>Massive fines (up to millions of dollars)</li> <li>Legal liability</li> <li>Loss of patient trust</li> <li>Harm to patients if records are altered</li> </ul> <p>This is why medical systems need defence in depth - multiple layers of security so that if one fails, others still protect the data.</p>"},{"location":"web_development/server_side_programming_authentication_template_engines/#extension-activities","title":"Extension Activities","text":"<p>If you completed everything and want

There are typically three architecture types for websites and web applications:</p> Type Description Processing Use Case Static Web Applications Deliver fixed, pre-built content to the user. Every user sees the exact same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Minimal to no server-side processing for content. Simple blogs, portfolios, documentation sites, or landing pages. Dynamic Web Applications (Multi-Page Applications - MPAs) Generate content in real-time based on user interaction or data stored in a database. A request to the server typically results in a full page reload to display new content. Significant server-side processing (using languages like Python, PHP, or Java) to build the page before sending it to the client. Traditional e-commerce sites, news sites, or large-scale educational platforms. Single-Page Applications (SPAs) Load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content within that page as the user interacts, without requiring a full page reload. This makes them feel faster and more like a native desktop or mobile application. Heavy reliance on client-side JavaScript (using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue) to manage the interface and data, communicating with the server only for data via APIs.

Text Alternatives (e.g., providing \"alt text\" for images), Captions for videos, sufficient color contrast for readability, and the ability to resize text. Operable User interface components and navigation must be operable. Keyboard Accessibility (all features must be usable without a mouse), providing enough time for users to read content or complete tasks, and preventing content that can cause seizures (like flashing more than three times per second). Understandable Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. Readability (using clear, simple language), ensuring navigation and interactive components are predictable and consistent across pages, and providing input assistance (e.g., clear error messages and labels for forms). Robust Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

Some of this information was later published on the dark web. </li> <li>Aftermath: The breach cost $140 million to address.

The attackers demanded a $10 million ransom, which Medibank refused to pay. </li> <li>Technical details: Hackers used stolen employee login credentials to gain access. The company's security system generated multiple alerts about suspicious activity, but these alerts were not reviewed and escalated quickly enough. </li> <li>Scope: Information from 9.7 million current and former Medibank members was stolen, including names, dates of birth, Medicare numbers, addresses, visa details, and sensitive health claims information such as mental health treatments and medical procedures. </li> <li>Aftermath: The stolen information was published on the dark web. Over 11,000 additional cybercrime incidents have since been linked to this breach, as criminals use the stolen information for fraud and identity theft. </li> <li>Financial impact: Estimated costs of $45 million, plus potential regulatory fines up to 50 million. </li> </ul> <p>Case 3: Latitude Financial Data Breach (2023)</p> <ul> <li>What happened: A cyberattack on Latitude Financial, an Australian personal loan and financial services provider, compromised information belonging to over 14 million people from Australia and New Zealand. </li> <li>Technical details: A single set of employee login credentials was stolen, providing hackers with access to customer databases.
